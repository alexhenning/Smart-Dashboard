* Overview
This is modification of Smart Dashboard from WPILib. This repository is a work in progress for FIRST team 348 in the 2011 season, however the intent is to add any useful feature back to the official dashboard. As a result, certain widgets or features (such as all my modifications to fakerobot) I add may be far too specific to be added back to the actual Smart Dashboard.

* Fake Robot
The fake robot sends random data to the dashboard. It is designed to be within what is reasonable for what is pretending to be, but it is rather jittery as a result.

If you'd like to customize it to your robot, modify main.java in client/fakerobot/src/.... Although, unless you're using a feature I've added and that hasn't been added to the official repository, I'd recommend checking it out from: http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/smartdashboard
